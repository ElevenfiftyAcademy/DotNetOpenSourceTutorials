//one of its inheritors you can create your own filters, for instance a log filter

//Sometimes you want to perform logic either before an action method is called or after an action method runs. To support this,
//ASP.NET MVC provides filters. Filters are custom classes that provide both a declarative and programmatic means to add pre-action
//and post-action behavior to controller action methods.

//You can think of it as a little box that sits between the users browser and your controller and filters out any invalid requests,
//or one that executes when a controller is done and you need to post process the result to the user.
